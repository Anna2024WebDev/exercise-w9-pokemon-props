# React Pokemon Props Exercise

In this weekâ€™s team session you will practice react basics and you will work on applying the concepts that we have learned throughout the week. This will be done during the scheduled team session, you decide in the team if to do it in small groups or pairs.

### Instructions:

Fetch the data from a JSON File and pass down the data from the parent component to its child component. Using the data.json you will create a list of pokemons. We've created the necessary components for you, now it's up to you to pass the props properly to these components. Donâ€™t forget the key attribute to avoid any console errors ðŸ˜‰

### Hint:

If you look at the last question on the Props section, you will have an example on how to approach this exercise ðŸ˜Ž
